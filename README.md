  * "Inspiring people to care about the planet." In the new edition of LIVING IN THE ENVIRONMENT, authors Tyler Miller and Scott Spoolman have partnered with the National Geographic Society to develop a text designed to equip students with the inspiration and knowledge they need to make a difference solving today's environmental issues. Exclusive content highlights important work of National Geographic Explorers, and features over 200 new photos, maps, and illustrations that bring course concepts to life. Using sustainability as the integrating theme, LIVING IN THE ENVIRONMENT 18e, provides clear introductions to the multiple environmental problems that we face and balanced discussions to evaluate potential solutions. In addition to the integration of new and engaging National Geographic content, every chapter has been thoroughly updated and 18 new Core Case Studies offer current examples of present environmental problems and scenarios for potential solutions. The concept-centered approach used in the text transforms complex environmental topics and issues into key concepts that students will understand and remember.
